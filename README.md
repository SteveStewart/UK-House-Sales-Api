# UK-House-Sale-History-Website
A learning project using ASP.NET MVC5 / MongoDB with the UK land registry house sale data from 1995-2016. This allows for the dataset (about 18,000,000 sale records) to be searched by postcode and filtered on a couple of things like property type, date of sale, etc.

The website may or may not be running here: http://ukhousesales.azurewebsites.net/. It depends on whether I've blown through my free azure credit on another project or not.

The land registry data can be found here: https://www.gov.uk/government/collections/price-paid-data
